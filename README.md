# Project 12 - SportSee (Nicolas Ka)

SportSee is a react application, scaffolded with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (using the [react-typescript template](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project))

## Prerequisites :

- I would recommend **VsCode** for the code editor, but you can take the one you prefer.
- **Node version**: 16.14.2 or above. [Click here to go to their download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- I personnally use [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager, it works the same way you would use NPM but it's a lot faster and lighter. (NPM comes by default with NodeJs if you don't want to install it)
- You will also need [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) if you don't have it already.

## Installation :

### Open your terminal of choice.

- Clone the repo with the following command : 
`git clone https://github.com/Nicoka11/NicolasKa_12_10072022.git`

- You will also need the backend : 
`git clone https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard.git`

### Once you have your 2 folders : 

For the backend : 
- `pnpm install` to install deps
- `pnpm dev` to start the server (running on port 3000 by default)

*At this point your server should be running.*<br/>
If you want to have additional info about the backend [click here](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard)


For the frontend : 
- `pnpm install` to install deps
- `pnpm dev` to start the app in watch mode.

*The app will be accessible on port 5173*

To switch from real to mocked data, of change the user id you can change the variables in `/env/.env` of the frontend project.
